        <p id = "par1"><b>On February 6th 2023</b> at 4:17 AM, the countries of Turkey and Syria were struck by a devastating
            magnitude 7.8 earthquake. About 9 hours later, an aftershock
            with a magnitude of 7.5 hit the same area. Throughout the next few days, these two countries and
            theircities of Gaziantep, Hatay, Kahramanmaras, Aleppo, and etc,
            were hit with hundreds of aftershocks.

        <br>
        
        <p>The confirmed death toll is <b>41,000+</b>, yet this number will continue to rise as rubble is
            cleared and bodies are found. </p> <br>
        <p>More than 25 million people have been affected by the earthquakes, including estimates of at least 7 million children.</p>

            However, not all hope is lost. Kerem Kinik, president of the Turkish Red Crescent, described the rescue and
            relief operations as a "marathon".
            He pointed out that relief operations in Turkey and Syria would continue for <b>another 18 months</b>.
